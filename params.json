{"name":"Edmontonwifi","tagline":"Android App Using Edmonton's Open Data","body":"EdmontonWifi\r\n============\r\n\r\n### How to use\r\nThis app should be pretty straightforward, but I'll get around to adding a help section sooner or later. This app will allow you to see your location to differnt objects in Edmonton, be it Wifi hotspots, current construction projects, and soon hopefully many more.\r\n\r\n### Future Plans\r\nYou can see what I'm sort of working on currently by checking out the [issues](https://github.com/tophernuts/EdmontonWifi/issues), but here are some of my more long term plans that aren't really visible in there.\r\n\r\n1. Add more datas\r\n  * To add functionality as well as creating a better overall structure for even more data in the future\r\n2. Make it look nice\r\n  * Right now it doesn't really look like a polished app, I'm telling myself that I'm waiting for Material Design to be officially released, but I'm just really not that good with UI stuff\r\n3. Add some tests\r\n4. Release to Google Play\r\n5. Figure out a good way to store things, maybe using the SODA API that is supported\r\n\r\n\r\n### History\r\nThis project started off as me trying to do something with [Edmonton's open data](https://data.edmonton.ca/). I first created an app that would load a list of [free public wifi locations](https://data.edmonton.ca/Facilities-and-Structures/WiFi-Locations-in-Edmonton/vbxz-36ag) and show the user the closest one to them. I originally thought that this would be useful by itself, as people who do not have Data plans would be able to see where a wifi hotspot was that they could use.\r\n\r\nHowever, after implementing that, no one would really care/I should really add more to this app, so that I can take advantage of all of the data sources that open data provides.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nFor any questions, comments, concerns, or condiments, you can contact me at tophernuts@gmail.com\r\nAny suggestions, criticisms, or ideas would be greatly appreciated! \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
